# Snort
🐷 Snort Network Intrusion Detection Project
📌 Project Overview
This project showcases the use of Snort, a powerful open-source network intrusion detection and prevention system (NIDS/NIPS). The goal is to monitor network traffic in real-time, detect potential threats using predefined rules, and log or alert on suspicious activity.

🎯 Objectives
Understand and implement Snort in NIDS mode.

Create custom Snort rules for detecting specific types of traffic or attacks.

Analyze traffic patterns and generate alerts.

Improve network security awareness and response.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Snort (Latest version)

Wireshark (for traffic analysis)

Ubuntu / Kali Linux (or any Linux distro)

TCPDump (for packet capture)

VirtualBox/VMware (optional for testing environment)

🧰 Project Setup
1. Prerequisites
Linux-based OS

Root access

Internet connection for package installation

2. Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snort
3. Configuration
Edit /etc/snort/snort.conf and ensure the following are configured:

Network variables (HOME_NET, EXTERNAL_NET)

Rules path

Logging directory

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
4. Running Snort
In IDS Mode:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
Replace eth0 with your network interface name.

With Custom Rule File:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0 -R /etc/snort/rules/custom.rules
✍️ Custom Rules Example
Detect a ping (ICMP echo request):

python
Copy
Edit
alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Ping Detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
📊 Output
Alerts: Displayed on the console or logged to /var/log/snort/

Logs: Detailed packet logs for post-analysis

🚀 Future Enhancements
Integrate with BASE or Snorby for web-based alert visualization

Use barnyard2 for better performance logging

Automate deployment with shell scripts or Ansible
